# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Added
- `ray import-apple <path>` — import Apple Card transactions from Apple's CSV export. Apple Card isn't supported by Plaid; this creates a manual account, maps Apple's categories to Ray's taxonomy so transactions participate in spending/scoring/budgets, and is safe to re-run monthly via hash-based deduplication (or `--replace-range` for authoritative overwrites of a date window).
- `ray import-apple --apr <percent>` — record the Apple Card's APR (e.g. `--apr 22.24`). Persisted into `liabilities.interest_rate`; re-runs without `--apr` preserve the prior stored rate via COALESCE, so you only need to set it once. In TTY mode the command also prompts interactively (blank to skip). Without an APR, AI debt tools now render the card as "APR unknown" rather than 0%.
- AI debt tooling now distinguishes "APR unknown" from "0% APR". `get_debts` renders `APR unknown` for debts with no stored `interest_rate` (e.g. Apple Card imports without `--apr`); `calculate_debt_payoff` sorts unknown-APR debts alongside high-rate debts under the avalanche strategy and simulates payoff at an assumed ~20% retail-card rate with an explicit note; `computeInsights` appends an "unknown APR" note listing the affected debts so the model asks the user to confirm or treats them as high-rate when advising on payoff order. Previously, a NULL `interest_rate` was silently coerced to 0, causing the AI to deprioritize Apple Card debt behind student loans and mortgages.

### Changed
- `ray import-apple` now stores Apple `Payment` rows as `LOAN_PAYMENTS`, matching Plaid's shape for credit-card payments (was `TRANSFER_IN` as a workaround for a pre-existing income-query bug). The root bug was fixed upstream in #12 — `INCOME_EXCLUDED_CATEGORIES` now covers `LOAN_PAYMENTS` everywhere, so Apple and Plaid both flow through the same code path with no special-casing. Users who already imported Apple CSVs on the prior branch should re-run `ray import-apple --replace-range <start> <end>` to rewrite those rows. Per-category displays will now show Apple Card payments under "Loan Payments" instead of "Transfer In" — more accurate, not a regression.
- `ray remove` now labels institutions by source in its listing — `(1 account, manual)` vs `(2 accounts, linked)` — instead of tagging every non-`manual-assets` institution as "linked". Matters when a manual-imported account (e.g. Apple Card) and a Plaid-linked account share a name.
- `ray import-apple` now applies your configured auto-recategorization rules immediately after a successful import, so Apple Card rows pick up the same categorization you'd get after the next `ray sync`. Dry-run (`--dry-run`) still previews only.
- Internal: extracted the auto-recategorization pass from `runDailySync` into `applyRecategorizationRules(db)` (new module `src/recategorization.ts`); shared by daily sync and Apple Card import.
- Internal: Debt Crusher achievement reverted to its pre-Apple query (`category != 'TRANSFER_IN'` on credit accounts), now that Apple payments land in `LOAN_PAYMENTS` alongside Plaid. Removes the label-based compensator that was added when Apple payments were remapped to `TRANSFER_IN`.
- Streak chaining (`no_restaurant_streak`, `no_shopping_streak`, `on_pace_streak`) now requires the most recent prior `daily_scores` row to be from the immediately preceding calendar day; any gap resets the streak to 1. Previously the prev-row lookup used `WHERE date < ? ORDER BY date DESC LIMIT 1`, which silently chained across multi-month gaps (e.g. a Dec 31 row with streak=7 would make the next scored day report streak=8 months later). To keep a single skipped sync from permanently breaking streaks, `ray sync` now backfills `daily_scores` for any un-scored calendar days between the newest scored row and yesterday before scoring yesterday itself.

### Fixed
- `ray import-apple --replace-range` now preserves user-applied notes/labels across Apple's retroactive description refinements. Previously the restore pass matched by `transaction_id` only — when Apple refined a row's description between exports (the exact case `--replace-range` is advertised to handle), the hashed id differed and the user's note/label silently vanished. Now falls back to a `(account_id, date, amount, merchant_name)` match when the id match fails; ambiguous or unmatched snapshots surface as warnings so you can re-apply manually. The import summary also surfaces dropped counts in `warnings`.
- `ray import-apple` now rejects out-of-range `--balance`, `--limit`, and `--apr` values at the CLI boundary. Negative balances/limits would corrupt `available_balance` and credit-utilization display; negative or >100% APR values would break `calculate_debt_payoff`'s simulation (negative monthlyRate, or 1000%-scale payment timelines). Interactive prompts enforce the same ranges so TTY entry can't bypass the flag check.
- `ray import-apple` now rejects calendar-impossible dates (e.g. `13/40/2026`, `02/31/2026`). Previously `parseDate` only validated the MM/DD/YYYY shape; bogus dates flowed into the `transactions.date` column and propagated silently — JS `Date` normalized them to real but incorrect dates (downstream streak/backfill), or produced NaN that crashed `runDailySync` with RangeError. The parser now round-trips through `Date.UTC` to verify the calendar is real (leap-year aware: Feb 29 2024 accepted, Feb 29 2025 rejected) and emits a warning so the user sees which row was skipped.
- `ray import-apple` no longer hides manually-added debts (`ray add … liability`) from `ray status`, debt views, and AI debt advice. `getDebts()` previously returned only `liabilities`-table rows when that table was non-empty; importing Apple Card populated `liabilities` and silently dropped manual car loans / mortgages that live only in `accounts`. Now unions both sources, keyed by `account_id`.
- `ray import-apple` now computes a daily score and checks achievements after a successful import, matching what `ray sync` does. Previously `ray status` / `ray score` showed no score data for Apple-only users (no Plaid institutions), because scoring was only wired into `runDailySync` which short-circuits on zero institutions.
- Auto-recategorization rules now fire for subcategory-only refinements. Previously, a rule like "Starbucks → `FOOD_AND_DRINK_COFFEE`" silently never ran if the transaction was already tagged `FOOD_AND_DRINK` at the top level — the `WHERE category != target_category` guard excluded it. Rules now fire whenever either `category` or `subcategory` differs from the target.
- Auto-recategorization rules with no `target_subcategory` now clear any stale subcategory on matched rows (e.g. a rule "Amazon → `GENERAL_MERCHANDISE`" applied to a row tagged `FOOD_AND_DRINK / FOOD_AND_DRINK_GROCERIES` now produces `GENERAL_MERCHANDISE / NULL`, not the inconsistent pair `GENERAL_MERCHANDISE / FOOD_AND_DRINK_GROCERIES`).
- Auto-recategorization rules now fire on rows with a NULL `category` (Apple Card's `Other` and any unmapped Apple category produce these). The `WHERE` guard wasn't null-safe — `NULL != target_category` yields NULL (falsy in SQLite's three-valued logic), silently excluding truly-uncategorized rows. Fixed with `COALESCE(category, '')`.
- `ray sync` now applies auto-recategorization rules *before* computing today's daily score, so a rule like "Amazon → `GENERAL_MERCHANDISE_ONLINE`" influences the same-day `shopping_count` and scoring. Previously the score reflected pre-rule categories and wouldn't catch up until the next sync. The score result is unchanged for users with no rules. Aligns `ray sync` with `ray import-apple`, which was already recat-first.
- `ray score` and the AI's `get_score` tool now suggest `ray import-apple` alongside `ray sync` when no daily scores exist yet. Previously both only mentioned `ray sync`, which is stale guidance for Apple-only users.
- `ray import-apple` now backfills daily scores across the full imported date range instead of scoring only yesterday. Streaks (no-restaurant, no-shopping, on-pace) now accumulate properly and streak-based achievements (Kitchen Hero, Detoxed, etc.) can unlock on first import. Previously, scoring one day produced streak=1 regardless of how many consecutive streak-qualifying days the CSV contained.
- `--replace-range` now covers the full CSV date window even when a boundary row has too few columns. Previously the delete window narrowed when the first or last row was malformed, leaving stale previously-imported rows at that boundary date.
- `ray accounts` heading changed from "Linked Accounts" to "Accounts" and empty state now mentions `ray add` and `ray import-apple` alongside `ray link`.
- `ray import` (backup restore) no longer silently drops recategorization rules that differ only by `target_subcategory`. The duplicate check now includes the subcategory with NULL-safe comparison.
- `getDebts()` no longer drops Plaid-synced mortgages and student loans from debt views. These liability types store `current_balance = NULL` in the `liabilities` table (actual balance is in `accounts`); the recent getDebts union fix filtered `WHERE l.current_balance > 0`, excluding them. Now uses `COALESCE(l.current_balance, a.current_balance)`.
- `categoryLabel()` no longer crashes on null/undefined categories — previously threw `Cannot read properties of null (reading 'split')` when the AI chat tool encountered a transaction with a null category.

### Known limitations
- Apple Card statements do not yet appear in `ray bills`. The bills view reads `liabilities.next_payment_due` + `minimum_payment`, which `ray import-apple` doesn't populate (Apple's CSV doesn't include statement schedule data). Follow-up: add optional `--due-day` / `--min-payment` flags to the import command.
